Reddit Rover
============

.. begin_description


RedditRover is a bot modular bot framework that makes it easy to host all kinds of reddit bots at once.
It is intended to make it easy for new and experienced Programmers to host a variety of bots that can react to Reddits
content without having to mangle with all ins and outs of reddit, praw and API limitations. Running it is easy:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ RedditRover/main.py

That will already do start the entire hosting and loading process - given you have already written a plugin,
it will start shortly after to fire content to your plugin.

.. begin_installation

Installation & Usage
--------------------

Running on Python 3+:

.. code-block:: python

    pip install praw --upgrade

All other dependencies are standard builtins. To be able to run this framework,
you will need to run ``praw-multiprocess`` to avoid higher API usage than from Reddits guidelines.

.. end_installation

Debugging
---------
Bot features are written in Abstract PluginBase Classes. Inherit from it and execute one of the test functions:
``test_single_submission(submission_id)``, ``test_single_comment(comment_id)`` or ``__test_single_thing(thing_id)``.
Other than that, use atomic tests of your features however you please. Instantiating a plugin on its own works and
supposed to test your features. Read into the documentation to get a detailed guide how this bot works and what you bot has to do.
