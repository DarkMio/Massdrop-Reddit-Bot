# How to use PyCharm File Templates (and IntelliJ)

## The easy way:

1. Open the File with an editor of your choice (works with PyCharm / IntelliJ, too)
2. Copy/Paste its contents.
3. Open the File Template Settings: File | Settings... | Editor > File and Code Templates **OR** if you have opened in
IntelliJ/PyCharm: Tools | Save File as Template... (but that saves it as global template across all projects)
4. That's it, you have now a project based template

## The hard way:

1. Copy/Paste both files here: ```~\.PyCharm40\config\fileTemplates``` **OR** ```~\.IdeaIC14\config\fileTemplates```
